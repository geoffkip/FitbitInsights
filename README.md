## Fitbit Data Analysis
As a data scientist and someone who loves to exercise I decided to combine my love for both and analyze my fitbit data to see if I could find any insights about my exercise habits.

### Downloading the fitbit data
To download my fitbit data for a year 2017 september to 2018 september I had to use the Export tool from the Fitbit website https://www.fitbit.com/settings/data/export. This allows you to request all the data fitbit records for you including every heart BPM, steps taken, active minutes and sleep. The request export can take a good amount of time so you might need to wait a bit. 
The data comes in JSON files and is super granular. Some data cleansing needs to be done to make the JSON data in a tabular format.
